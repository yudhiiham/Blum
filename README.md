### 1. Play Game Every 5 Hours
- Automated gameplay that runs in cycles
- Each cycle includes:
  - Daily reward checking and claiming
  - Automatic Farming Balance
  - Automatic game play for all accounts
  - Waiting period of 5 hours before next cycle
- Perfect for long-term farming
- Single input for points and threads at start
- Continues until manually stopped (Ctrl+C)
- Telegram notifications for each cycle completion

### 2. Play Game (One Time)
- Single session gameplay
- Play until all tickets are used
- Stops automatically when complete
- Needs manual restart for new session
- Fresh input for points and threads each time
- Good for short-term or controlled farming
- Telegram notification on completion

The main difference:
- "Play Game Every 5 Hours" is designed for automated, long-term farming with minimal user intervention
- Regular "Play Game" is for single-session farming that requires manual restart
- Both features support multi-threading and Telegram notifications, but differ in automation level

Choose "Play Game Every 5 Hours" if you want:
- Continuous farming with automatic cycles
- Daily reward automation
- Minimal manual intervention
- Long-term operation

Choose "Play Game" if you want:
- More control over each session
- Single-run operations
- Manual management of play sessions
- Short-term farming
